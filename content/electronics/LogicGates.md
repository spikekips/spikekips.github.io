## Transistor AND Gates
And Gates are a way to determine if two inputs are both on. If both inputs are on then the output is on.

If one input is off then the output will turn off.

## Transistor NAND Gate

## OR Gate

## NOR Gate

## NOT Gate

## XOR Gate

### XOR 1
If both are on then current flow to ground 0. This means the transitro Q13 won't turn on so the diode will have no current flow.

If only one input is on then current flows through the diode

If there is no input then no current flows but Q13 does turn on.

### XOR 2
Same as XOR 1 but has output that can be sent to other things

Has a not gate to invert the inversion without the inversion it'd end up being an XNOR Gate.
