Hey thanks for stoping by! I'm **Sam** and this is my site. It's mostly notes and things I find interesting, along with any info I might want others to be able to access.

### My Background
I graduated from college with an associates in Comp Sci, I've been working with computers long before that. Most of my experience is with Circuitry, Coding, and Computer hardware. If I find anything interesting and I think it will be useful to anyone else I'll be putting that stuff up here.

### What I get up to
If i'm not working on a computer i'm probably out skating or gaming. I prefer to be away from the computer when I don't need to be though.

### Let’s Connect
Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out with any questions or critiques you may have. I'm still learning so if you see anything I might be missing in any articles please let me know.
