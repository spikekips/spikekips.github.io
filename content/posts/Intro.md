*Poison* is a **clean**, **professional** Hugo theme designed to **captivate** your readers.

It's also **tiny** and **privacy conscious**.  No JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts.  No ads or trackers polluting your console window.  **We kept things simple**.  A little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo.

All the static assets for the site (JS files, CSS, and fonts) are located within the theme's */assets/* directory.  **That way you know *exactly* what's going onto your site**.

Check out our demo site's analytics [here](https://plausible.lukeorth.com/poison.lukeorth.com) to gauge community interest in the theme.

## Features

In addition to the standard Built-in templates and shortcodes that come with Hugo, *Poison* offers some unique features of its own.

### Light & dark mode

Give readers the choice to read in light or dark mode.  The user's preference is remembered and saved in local storage.  Light mode is the default for first time visitors, but you can change this in your config file.

### Table of contents

Provide a floating table of contents for readers with large enough screens (i.e. *screen-width > 1600 pixels*).

If you prefer not to display a table of contents, you can disable them site-wide in your ```config.toml``` file.

{{< highlight toml >}}
[params]
    hideToc: true
{{</highlight >}}

Alternatively, you can choose to disable the table of contents on a per-post basis by putting the flag in the frontmatter of an individual post.

### Comments

Facilitate discourse by allowing users to comment on your posts.  *Poison* currently supports two different commenting engines for this purpose -- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [Remark42](https://remark42.com/).

**Note**: *Enabling comments will add external dependencies.*

- [Disqus Demo Site](https://about.disqus.com/disqus-demo-page) 
- [Remark42 Demo Site](https://remark42.com/demo/)

***Disqus*** is free and easy to use.  Checkout the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/) to get started.  Once you've created a *Disqus* account, you can activate it in the *Poison* theme by adding a single line to your `config.toml` file.

{{< highlight text >}}
disqusShortname = 'yourDisqusShortname'
{{</highlight >}}

This is a great option for people that don't want to bother with self-hosting their own commenting engine; however, it has some drawbacks.  Because *Disqus* provides this service for free, they recoup any financial loss by injecting third-party ad trackers onto your website.  These trackers help to collect and sell information about your users, while also negatively affecting your site's speed.

Even still, *Disqus* may be the best solution depending on your situation (we use it on this demo site).  The above paragraph is only meant to highlight its trade-offs and not meant to discourage its use entirely.

***Remark42*** is a lightweight, open source commenting engine that doesn't spy on your users.  The downside is that you must host it yourself.  Checkout the *Remark42* [documentation](https://remark42.com/) to get started.  I also found [this blog post](https://www.devbitsandbytes.com/setting-up-remark42-from-scratch/) helpful when setting it up on [my site](https://lukeorth.com).

Once everything is set up, you can activate it in the *Poison* theme by including the following in the `[params]` section of your `config.toml` file.

{{< highlight text >}}
[params]
    remark42 = true
    remark42_host = "https://yourhost.com"
    remark42_site_id = "your_site_id"
{{</highlight >}}


### Analytics

Gain insights on your users.  Poison currently supports [Plausible](https://plausible.io) which is available via a paid service or by [self-hosting](https://github.com/plausible/analytics).

**Note**: *Enabling analytics will add external dependencies.*

**Check out our demo site's Plausible analytics [here](https://plausible.lukeorth.com/poison.lukeorth.com)!**

Once you've established your Plausible instance, you can activate it by adding three lines to your ``config.toml`` file.

{{< highlight toml >}}
[params]
    plausible = true
    plausible_domain = "myblog.com"
    plausible_script = "https://plausible.myblog.com/js/script.js"
{{</highlight >}}

This will insert the necessary code in the ``<head>`` on each page and will allow your Plausible instance to collect a limited set of data on your users.

For reference, the configuration above would add the following code to each page.  Adjust according to your specific environment.

{{< highlight text >}}
<script defer data-domain="myblog.com" src="https://plausible.myblog.com/js/script.js"></script>
{{</highlight >}}

### Email newsletters

Allow users to subscribe to your blog newsletters via email. 
Poison currently supports [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) which is available via [self-hosting](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk).
Listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager.
The downside is that you must host it yourself. 
Checkout the Listmonk [documentation](https://listmonk.app/docs/) to get started.

Once you've established your Listmonk instance, activate it by adding these lines to your ``config.toml`` file.

{{< highlight toml >}}
[params]
    listmonk = true
    listmonk_host = "https://listmonk.your_domain.tld"
    listmonk_subscription_list_uiid = "YOUR_NEWSLETTERS_LIST_UIID"
    listmonk_subscription_form_text = "Subscribe to my newsletters"       # default: Subscribe to my newsletters
    listmonk_subscription_success_message = "Thanks for subscribing"      # default: Thanks for subscribing
    listmonk_subscription_error_message = "Something went wrong"          # default: Sorry, something went wrong. Please, try again
{{</highlight >}}

This will insert a form at the bottom of each post's content. 
The user will be subscribed to the newsletter specified in the `listmonk_subscription_list_uiid` parameter.

### Series

Sensibly link and display content in "series" (i.e. *Tutorial One*, *Tutorial Two*, etc.).
   
This is done with a custom taxonomy. Just add `series` to the frontmatter on any content you want to group together.

{{< highlight yaml >}}

### KaTeX

Make your mathematical notations pop.

For notations that should appear on their own line, use the block quotes `$$ ... $$`
    
$$ 5 \times 5 = 25 $$

For notations that should appear on the same line, use the inline quotes `$ ... $`

**Note**: *Enabling KaTeX will add external dependencies.*
    
### Tabs

Some content is just better viewed in tabs.  There's a shortcode for that.

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}

{{% tab tabName="First Tab" %}}
This is **markdown** content.
{{% /tab %}}

{{< tab tabName="Second Tab" >}}
{{< highlight text >}}
This is a code block.
{{</ highlight >}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

---
Here's the code for the tabs above...

{{< highlight text >}}
{{</* tabs tabTotal="2" */>}}

{{%/* tab tabName="First Tab" */%}}
This is markdown content.
{{%/* /tab */%}}

{{</* tab tabName="Second Tab" */>}}
{{</* highlight text */>}}
This is a code block.
{{</* /highlight */>}}
{{</* /tab */>}}

{{</* /tabs */>}}
{{</ highlight >}}
   
### Mermaid diagrams

There's a shortcode for embedding Mermaid diagrams.

**Note**: *Enabling Mermaid diagrams will add external dependencies.*

{{< mermaid >}}
sequenceDiagram
participant Alice
participant Bob
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br>prevail!
John-->>Alice: Great!
John->>Bob: How about you?
Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
{{< /mermaid >}}

Here's the code for the diagram above:

{{< highlight text >}}
{{</* mermaid */>}}
sequenceDiagram
participant Alice
participant Bob
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br>prevail!
John-->>Alice: Great!
John->>Bob: How about you?
Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
{{</* /mermaid */>}}
{{</ highlight >}}

### PlantUML diagrams

There's a shortcode for embedding PlantUML diagrams.

**Note**: *Enabling PlantUML diagrams will add external dependencies.*

{{< plantuml id="foo" >}}
a -> b
b -> c
{{< /plantuml >}}

Here's the code for the diagram above:

{{< highlight text >}}
{{</* plantuml id="foo" */>}}
a -> b
b -> c
{{</* /plantuml */>}}
{{</ highlight >}}

### Details

There's a shortcode for encoding detail dropdowns into your pages.

{{< details summary="A detail dropdown" >}}
Markdown content
{{< /details >}}

Here's the code for the detail dropdown above:

{{< highlight text >}}
{{</* details summary="A detail dropdown" */>}}
Markdown content
{{</* /details */>}}
{{</ highlight >}}

## How to Configure

After successfully installing *Poison*, the last step is to configure it.

### The sidebar menu

Any items you want displayed in your sidebar menu *must* satisfy two requirements.  They must:

1. Have a corresponding markdown file in your */content/* directory.
2. Be declared in your *config.toml* file (example below).

There are two types of menu items:

1. **Single Page** -- The *About* menu item (to the left) is a good example of this.  It displays a direct link to an individual page.
2. **List** -- The *Posts* menu item is a good example of this.  It displays a directory and dynamically lists the contents (i.e. pages) contained by date.  List items have two optional configurations: a subheading (like the *Recent* subheading that appears on the menu to the left), and a maximum number of items to display.

The sidebar menu items are configured with a dictionary value in your *config.toml* file.  I've included an example below.  Additionally, there is a placeholder for this in the *config.toml* file shown in the next section.

**Remember**: You must have a markdown file present at the path specified for the menu item to be displayed.

{{< highlight toml >}}
menu = [
        # Dict keys:
            # Name:         The name to display on the menu.
            # URL:          The directory relative to the content directory.
            # HasChildren:  If the directory's files should be listed.  Default is true.
            # Limit:        If the files should be listed, how many should be shown.

        # SINGLE PAGE
        # Note that you must put your markdown file 
        # inside of a directory with the same name.

        # Example:
        # ... /content/about/about.md
        {Name = "About", URL = "/about/", HasChildren = false},
        
        # LIST
        # This example has a subheading of "Recent"
        # and will display up to 5 items.

        # Example:
        # ... /content/posts/introducing-poison.md
        {Name = "Posts", URL = "/posts/", Pre = "Recent", HasChildren = true, Limit = 5},

        # Example of a list without a subheading or limit.
        {Name = "Projects", URL = "/projects/"},
    ]
{{</highlight >}}

### The front page
When visiting the base url for the site, i.e. `your.domain.com/`, a paginated feed of your recently added content is displayed in reverse chronological order. By default, only content in the "posts" [page bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) is displayed. You can configure a list of page bundle names to be included on this page by adding the `front_page_content` parameter to your config.toml file.

{{< highlight toml >}}
[params]
  front_page_content = ["posts", "projects"]
{{</highlight >}}

### Example config
I recommend starting by copying/pasting the following code into your config.toml file.  Once you see how it looks, play with the settings as needed.

**NOTE**: To display an image in your sidebar, you'll need to uncomment the `brand_image` path below and have it point to an image file in your project.  The path is relative to the `static` directory.  If you don't have an image, just leave this line commented out.

{{< highlight toml >}}
baseURL = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "poison"
paginate = 10
pluralizelisttitles = false   # removes the automatically appended "s" on sidebar entries

# NOTE: If using Disqus as commenting engine, uncomment and configure this line
# disqusShortname = "yourDisqusShortname"

[params]
    brand = "Poison"                      # name of your site - appears in the sidebar
    # brand_image = "/images/test.jpg"    # path to the image shown in the sidebar
    description = "Update this description..." # Used as default meta description if not specified in front matter
    dark_mode = true                      # optional - defaults to false
    # favicon = "favicon.png"             # path to favicon (defaults to favicon.png)

    # MENU PLACEHOLDER
    # Menu dict keys:
        # Name:         The name to display on the menu.
        # URL:          The directory relative to the content directory.
        # HasChildren:  If the directory's files should be listed.  Default is true.
        # Limit:        If the files should be listed, how many should be shown.
    menu = [
        {Name = "About", URL = "/about/", HasChildren = false},
        {Name = "Posts", URL = "/posts/", Pre = "Recent", HasChildren = true, Limit = 5},
    ]

    rss_icon = true
    # Which section the RSS icon links to, defaults to all content. See https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#section-rss

### Custom CSS

You can override any setting in Poison's static CSS files by adding your own `/assets/css/custom.css` file. For example, if you want to override the title font and font size, you could add this:

{{< highlight toml >}}
.sidebar-about h1 {
  font-size: 1.4em;
  font-family: "Monaco", monospace;
}
{{</highlight >}}
