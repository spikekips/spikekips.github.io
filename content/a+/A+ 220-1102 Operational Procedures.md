# General Information
  - Any IT operation must have procedures in place covering safety, communication, professionalism, and environmental impact
  - These must be  standard for all people with access to the system and must be accurately communicated and recorded for reference
  - The procedures must also be  based on industry best practices
  - The CompTIA A+ 1102 test assesses your knowledge of operational procedures in 22% of the questions
  - A little  over half (about 56%) of the questions about operational procedures will begin with a scenario.
# Documentation and Support Systems
  - Documentation is the **final step in the troubleshooting process** and is vital to the smooth running of the network and system
  - Documentation best practices and policies are designed to streamline the running and troubleshooting of a network or system
  - Questions in this  section will be scenario based, and you should be able to implement best practices pertaining to creating and maintaining documentation as well  as the support systems involved in the documentation process.
## Ticketing Systems
  
  - A ticketing system is a system that creates individual tickets or requests for assistance from the IT department
  - A ticketing system  provides a **method of tracking**, addressing, and recalling instances of issues encountered by users
  - A ticketing system also provides **accountability**, reporting, collaboration, remediation, and escalation tracking to  ensure that the help desk is running as efficiently and effectively as  possible.
### User Information
  - When opening a ticket, the user information is typically the **first thing collected**
  - This information is essential for communication between the user and  the technician responding to the ticket
  - User information may include  the user name, full name, phone number, and/or email address of the  user.
### Device Information
  - Device information is collected to provide the technician with **additional insight** into what may be the cause of the problem
  - Examples of device  information include device type, model number, OS being used, and  network access type, among others.
### Description of Problems
  - The user will be asked to enter a description of the issues encountered
  - It is important to gather as much information from the user as possible
  - For example, what is occurring, when does it occur, and  what actions the user took to initiate the problem.
### Categories
  - Most ticketing systems have the ability to categorize issues
  - Categorizing allows for the ticket to be **filtered and referred** to the person or department that is best suited to address the issues
  - For example, categories may include database issues, operating system  issues, networking issues, or peripheral issues.
### Severity
  - A **severity level** is assigned to a ticket by the user and the technician to address the **urgency** of the problem
  - Keep in mind that when a user is reporting a problem,  the user may feel that the issue is more severe and urgent than it  actually is
  - The technician must use their best judgment when assigning  severity levels to a ticket.
### Escalation Levels
  - Escalation levels, or levels of support, refer to the structure of the IT department as a whole
  - While every enterprise structure may vary, they are typically numbered levels 1 to 3, with **level 1** responders having basic knowledge, **level 2** having advanced knowledge, and **level 3** having expert knowledge
  - If a level 1 technician is unable to address the problem, it can be escalated to the next level.
### Clear and Concise Written Communication
  - Written communication between the user, the technician, and any escalation points should be clear and concise
  - There are **three stages** of documentation of communication between the involved parties: the  description of the problem, progress notes, and the resolution.
#### Problem Description
  - The first stage involves the description of the problem
  - The problem description should be as clear and understandable as possible so the  user, technician, and any other person reading can follow it
  - Try to  avoid using highly technical jargon or references.
#### Progress Notes
  - Progress notes should be written to **document the steps** that are being taken to address or resolve the issue
  - Progress notes should also document the **communications** that occur between the user and the technician so that, if reviewed, a  clear timeline of actions and interactions is presented, which may be  needed for escalation or review.
#### Problem Resolution
  - The final part of the written communication documentation is the problem resolution
  - This should include what steps were taken to resolve the problem, and it should be easy to follow by others, such as another technician who encounters the same issue.
## Asset Management
  
  - Asset management is the process of keeping track of the **fixed tangible assets** of a company
  - Asset management systems track physical assets throughout their lifespan.
### Inventory Lists
  - Inventory lists are a record of all the assets of a company detailing equipment types and quantity
  - Inventory lists are useful and sufficient for smaller enterprises but may become overwhelming with larger  inventories.
### Database System
  - For **larger inventories or more complex asset lists**, a database system can be created and used
  - A database system has the  ability to store and retrieve asset information quickly and efficiently  and can also provide insight into asset usage, value, and trends
  - Asset  management systems are database systems.
### Asset Tags and IDs
  - An asset tag or ID is a method used to **track equipment** within an asset management system, typically in the form of a scannable barcode with an assigned numeric number
  - This allows the asset  management system to identify all equipment as well as retrieve data  associated with the asset tag.
### Procurement Life Cycle
  - The procurement life cycle is the **life cycle of an asset within an enterprise**
  - The procurement life cycle for IT typically starts with the purchase of the asset, the deployment of the asset, the continued management of the asset, and the retirement of the asset
  - The procurement life cycle can  be tracked manually or with an asset management system.
### Warranty and Licensing
  - Some assets may come with the manufacturers’ warranties or licensing agreements
  - The warranty and licensing information can be tracked with  asset management as well
  - Monitoring warranty and licensing information  is necessary to stay up to date on potential warranty or licensing  expirations that **may affect the life cycle** of the asset.
### Assigned Users
  - Assigned users are the end users who are responsible for an asset
  - Assigned users are typically monitored by an IT manager who is  ultimately responsible for the assets and users of those assets, such as laptops or cellular phones.
## Types of Documents
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - It’s vital to ensure that you read any required documentation before you begin working on any system
  - Documentation includes items such as  processes and procedures, network diagrams, **knowledge base articles** (also known as **KBs**), and much more
  - It’s also important to document any fixes that have been implemented so they can be referenced later
  - Another example of  documentation includes **safety data sheets (SDS)**,  formerly referred to as material safety data sheets (MSDS)
  - The SDS  outlines the procedures for disposing of hazardous materials
  - This  should be referenced if there is a question about properly disposing of  hazardous material
  - The SDS is administered by the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** within the United States.
### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
  - An AUP is a policy put in place by an organization that states which types of actions are acceptable to perform using their equipment
  - Many  organizations implement AUPs that state how employees are allowed to use their **company-owned devices**
  - Whenever accessing a  public Wi-Fi, such as at a coffee shop, you will have to acknowledge the AUP before getting access to the network.
### Network Topology Diagram
  - Network topology diagrams are extremely helpful for performing any network upgrades or even troubleshooting networking problems
  - The  network topology diagrams will provide a visual representation of how  the network is laid out, including both logical and physical information for the devices
### Visio
  - is a popular tool used when creating network diagrams.
### Regulatory Compliance Requirements
  - Networks are required to follow specific regulatory requirements, which can be local, state, or federal
  - Common regulations include the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**, which regulates how companies protect and maintain financial records and data
  - The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**, contains federal regulations that protect the privacy of medically related **personally identifiable information (PII)** and data
  - The **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** regulates the processing and handling of student data
  - The **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)** protects consumer information gathered by financial institutions.
#### Splash Screens
  - Compliance is the process of adhering to all relevant regulations, including local and federally set guidelines
  - To document compliance, it may be necessary to use screenshots which are generally accepted forms  of proof of compliance
  - A splash screen is a screen capture that can be  used to document problems, solutions, and the installation of software
  - The Windows OS includes the**Steps Recorder**, which documents each mouse click with a screen capture and information on what was clicked.
### Incident Reports
  - An incident report is documentation of events outside the norm of usual processes, such as a security issue, an outage, or a customer  service complaint
  - Incident reports should be thorough and contain the  date and time of the incident, an incident summary, the root cause, the  actions taken in response to the incident, the remediation efforts, what systems or services were impacted, and the recommendations for  preventing or addressing similar incidents in the future.
### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
  - SOPs document the specified steps that should be followed to comply with policies or regulations set by the company and outside entities
  - The SOP provides a plan of action for meeting those policies.
#### Procedures for Custom Installation of Software Package
  - When installing custom software packages, the entire process should be **clearly documented** by the initial technician who installed the package
  - This creates a document and process that can be followed by other technicians for  subsequent installations of the package.
### New-User Setup Checklist
  - New employees in a company need to be onboarded, which is commonly coordinated between the IT department and Human Resources
### Onboarding
  - is the process of entering the employee into the network, assigning relevant **permissions and devices**, and informing the new hire about **policies and procedures** for the company
  - A new-user setup checklist is helpful in the  onboarding process to ensure all necessary actions have been taken
  - A  new-user setup list may include assigning and showing a user how to log  in to the network, informing them of AUPs and “bring your own device”  (BYOD) policies, and going over email policies and procedures.
### End-User Termination Checklist
  - When an employee leaves a company, the employee will need to be **offboarded**, which is the process of removing the user from network access and  retrieving assigned devices
  - An end-user termination checklist is a list that provides set actions that need to be taken when an employee is  offboarded and ensures that something has not been overlooked during the process.
## Knowledge Base Articles
  
  - A knowledge base is a repository of information regarding an application or system
  - When working on a system or troubleshooting an  issue, individuals should first visit the system’s knowledge base to see if a solution to their issue already exists.
# Change Management
  - Change management is the process of addressing changes within an organization
  - Whenever a change is going to be made in an organization,  proper procedures must be followed to ensure that any negative impact on the business or users is minimized
  - You will need to be able to explain change management best practices.
## Documented Business Processes
  
  - Documented business processes provide a high-level overview of what aspects of the business the change is expected to impact
  - This document  states who, how, why, and when **interactions** occur during the change process.
### Rollback Plan
  - A rollback plan, or backout plan, documents the steps that will be taken in case of implementation or **primary plan failure**
  - A backout plan should include a **way to revert** to a previous version of the system before the change was applied.
### Sandbox Testing
  - A sandbox test is done in a **separate environment** that matches the existing environment
  - It can be used to test and  evaluate the effects of potential changes to a system or network without affecting the real system
  - Sandbox testing allows for fine-tuning of an implementation plan prior to actual deployment.
### Responsible Business Process Staff Member
  - The responsible staff member is the employee designated as responsible for a particular change process
  - This person **oversees** the change plan as well as acts as a **point of contact** for the plan
  - The responsible staff member should also be able to  answer questions related to the change as well as spearhead any  subsequent changes to the plan.
### Request Forms
  - A request form is a form that **proposes a change**
  - Request forms typically include information such as what needs to be  changed, why the change is needed, and the plan for the change as well  as the priority of the change
  - The request form also includes the  rollback plan, the evaluation of the plan, and the time it will take to  implement the change.
### Purpose of the Change
  - The purpose of the change is the reason why the change needs to occur
  - This reason can be new business requirements, regulation  requirements, or technological requirements.
### Scope of the Change
  - The scope of the change lays out **what will be affected** by the change
  - The scope may be small, affecting only a few devices, or extensive, affecting the entire network
  - When detailing scope, **specific details** should be addressed, such as how many systems will be affected, how  many employees will be affected, and any other direct or indirect  consequences of the change.
### Date and Time of the Change
  - The data and time of the change specify the temporal timeline of the change and should be chosen to impact the least amount of business  function possible.
### Affected Systems/Impact
  - Affected systems are the systems that will be impacted by the change in some manner
  - This document should also include the impact the change  will or may have on the affected systems, such as production time lost  or how customers may be affected.
### Risk Analysis
  - A risk analysis is a detailed evaluation of the change and the risks that come with making the change
  - The risk analysis examines the  potential failure of a change and the impact that failure may have on  the company
  - Upon defining the new risks that may arise, the  organization must choose to **accept, mitigate, or avoid the risk**.
#### Risk Level
  - The risk level is a measurement of the potential impact of failure on the company
  - Risk levels include low, medium, or high risk.
### Change Board Approvals
  - The change board is the group of users who are in charge of determining whether to proceed or table a potential change
  - The change  board evaluates the entire change from all perspectives in order to  decide the most effective way to proceed to provide the least amount of  impact on the company and day-to-day functions.
### End-User Acceptance
  - In order for a successful change to occur, all users must be on board and prepared for the change
  - User acceptance testing is a common  practice in which real users ensure that the change doesn’t negatively  affect their ability to perform tasks.
# Workstation Backup and Recovery
  - All organizations should have a **business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR)** plan documented and in place
  - Disaster prevention and recovery refers  to the ability to be able to bounce back after any type of disaster,  such as a natural disaster or a cyber attack
  - Questions in this section  will be scenario based.
## Backup and Recovery
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - A backup is a stored data clone of a workstation, device, OS, files, or network that can be used in case of disaster or if needed for  recovery
  - The backup provides a **recovery point objective (RPO)**, which is a point in time to which a dataset can be restored
  - A backup can be a full backup of the entire dataset at a specified point in time  or a partial backup of the changes since the previous backup.
### Full Backup
  - A full backup **copies the entire dataset** at a specific point in time and may include the OS, files, and  personalizations
  - A full backup can be used to completely restore a  dataset in case of complete failure
  - A full backup, however, is memory  intensive and time consuming.
### Incremental
  - An incremental backup uses an archive bit set to back up data written on the archive bit set **since the last incremental backup**
  - Once the incremental backup occurs, the archive bit set is reset and  ready to store the data captured from the point of the last incremental  backup
  - In case of failure, a full backup would need to be restored, as  well as all incremental backups, until the dataset is fully restored.
### Differential
  - A differential backup also employs the use of the archive bit set
  - Unlike the incremental backup, however, the differential backup **does not reset the archive bit set until a full backup** is completed
  - The differential backup grows in size until the full  backup
  - In case of failure, a full backup would need to be restored, but unlike the incremental backup, only the latest differential backup  would need to be restored for the dataset to be complete.
### Synthetic
  - A synthetic backup is software that creates a full backup by combining the last full backup with incremental or differential backups  to create a complete dataset
  - This reduces the recovery time objective  (RTO), the amount of time it takes to restore a dataset.
## Backup Testing
  
  - It’s not enough to perform backups; the backups must also be tested
  - The test serves to show that the backup files are not corrupt and that  they are backing up everything that would need to be restored in the  event of a disaster.
### Frequency
  - The frequency of backup testing differs, but it is recommended that backup testing be conducted **monthly at a minimum**, with highly sensitive or constantly changing dataset backups tested more frequently.
## Backup Rotation Schemes
  
  - A backup rotation scheme is a schedule used to guide the rotation of long-term data archiving by the backup source and location
  - Rotation  schemes include the type of media used for the backup as well as the  physical location of the backup
  - Backup media types include  disk-to-tape, disk-to-disk, and disk-to-cloud.
### Onsite  vs. Offsite
  - Onsite backups are physically kept on the same premises as the dataset that it backs up
  - An offsite backup is kept in a different  physical location from the dataset
  - Data backups should be rotated offsite in case of a major disaster.
### Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS)
  - The GFS rotation scheme is a first-in, first-out schedule for rotation
  - Backups are taken daily
  - At the end of the week, the last daily backup will become the weekly backup, and at the end of the month, the last weekly backup will become the monthly backup.
### 3-2-1 Backup Rule
  - The 3-2-1 backup rule pertains to maintaining both onsite and offsite rotation
  - To apply this rule, three copies of a backup should be taken, with two copies of the backup kept onsite while the **final copy is kept offsite**.
# Safety Procedures
  - When dealing and working with computer components, keep safety at the forefront for both your and the device’s sake
  - The following sections  may be delivered as scenario-based questions in the exam environment, so you must be very comfortable with these topics.
## Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Straps
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - ESD occurs when two objects with dissimilar charges come in contact with one another
  - Electrons are exchanged to equalize the charge,  resulting in ESD, which can damage sensitive components
  - ESD straps are  small wrist straps that can connect to an ESD mat or an ESD jacket for  discharge to reduce your electrostatic presence.
## ESD Mats
  
  - An ESD mat drains excess charges away from items in contact with it
  - An ESD mat can either be a mat you stand on (floor mat) or a mat you  place the equipment on
  - These ESD mats will reduce ESD risks, and some  allow you to snap your ESD wristband into them for better protection.
## Equipment Grounding
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - Equipment grounding is a way to transport any excess electrical discharge away from the component and into the electrical ground wiring
  - This is a safety mechanism that is included on all outlets,  significantly reducing the risk of electrical shock should there be a  fault within the system.
## Proper Power Handling
  
  - The **power supply** is the **most dangerous component** of a computer to work with
  - A power supply contains capacitors that can hold a charge even when disconnected from a power source
  - If possible,  it is safer to replace the power supply rather than work on it
  - If the  power supply must be accessed, make sure that all capacitors within the  power supply are discharged prior to handling
  - A grounding pen or a  discharge pen can be used for discharging capacitors of any size.
## Proper Component Handling and Storage
  
  - Technicians must be aware of proper component handling and storage
  - Each component comes with safety considerations
  - Before attempting to  handle a component, research the safety measures and concerns pertaining to the component
  - Properly storing components includes evaluating the **environment**, such as humidity and temperature, as well as the component’s **potential for ESD**.
## Antistatic Bags
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - An antistatic bag is a specially designed, typically pink or silver bag that collects stray static charges on its exterior, preventing the  charge from reaching the sensitive components it contains.
## Compliance with Government Regulations
  
  - When dealing with a networking environment, there are several regulations to keep in mind
  - These include electrical codes for running  high/low voltage cabling, environmental codes for disposing of chemicals or hardware, fire prevention codes requiring the specific use of dry or wet systems, and building codes that specify how cabling can be run  through a building.
## Personal Safety
  
  - Personal safety begins with you
  - As a technician, you should be aware of and follow best practices for maintaining personal safety
  - Be  familiar with the following guidelines related to personal safety when  dealing with computer components.
### Disconnect Power before Repairing PC
  - All power sources should be disconnected prior to working inside a computer
  - Power supplies are typically replaced as a whole rather than  in smaller individual parts
  - Normally there are **no serviceable parts** inside, and, therefore, they should not be opened.
### Lifting Techniques
  - Always lift heavy equipment using your legs and not your back, or use multiple people to lift the object.
### Electrical Fire Safety
  - For electrical fires, use specialized **dry fire prevention or extinguishing chemicals**, such as carbon dioxide
  - Neither wet chemicals nor water should ever be used on electrical fires.
### Safety Goggles
  - Use goggles when working with chemicals, batteries, or printer toner.
### Air Filtration Mask
  - To protect yourself from an environment where dust, smoke, or other air particles exist in the surrounding atmosphere, you should wear a  special mask designed to filter out these items.
# Environmental Impacts and Controls
  - You should be able to quickly analyze and apply the proper controls for any possible environmental impacts
  - Some questions in this area will be scenario based.
## Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
  
  - The SDS outlines the procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials
  - This should be referenced if there is a question  about properly disposing of hazardous material
  - The SDS is administered  by the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** in the United States
  - Copies are kept locally wherever there might be contact with hazardous materials.
### Battery Disposal
  - The most common batteries used in computers and electronic devices are alkaline, nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-metal hydride (NiMH),  lithium-ion (Li-ion), and button cells
  - The Mercury-Containing and  Rechargeable Battery Management Act (or just The Battery Act) provides  guidelines on the disposal, collection, and recycling of batteries
  - All  batteries should be **recycled**.
### Toner Disposal
  - Toner cartridges should also be recycled
  - Toner cartridges contain carcinogens and heavy metals, which negatively affect the environment
  - Companies that recycle toner cartridges refurbish and refill the  cartridges for further use.
### Other Devices and Assets
  - Other devices and assets, such as display devices and mobile devices, should also be sent to a recycling facility that can safely dispose of  or recycle the component
  - The key takeaway here is that the majority of  computer and networking components you may encounter should not be  thrown out but recycled.
## Temperature, Humidity, and Ventilation
  
  - The temperature and humidity in the environment where components are stored should reflect the levels outlined in the SDS
  - For an electronic  environment, it is usually best to balance the humidity as efficiently  as possible to avoid extreme condensation or static discharge
  - It is  also important to keep a closed-in area well-ventilated so the room does not become too hot when the equipment is running.
### Location/Equipment Placement
  - When placing equipment, always evaluate the location where the equipment will be placed, whether you are dealing with a single simple  device or a large bank of servers or switches
  - Be aware of potential  hazards, such as temperature, ventilation, tripping hazards, or water  hazards.
### Dust Cleanup
  - Dust buildup can be highly detrimental to sensitive components, causing them to work less efficiently, overheat, or fail
  - Dust removal  must be approached cautiously so as not to do more damage to the  component than the dust itself
  - Compressed air and vacuums are common  methods of dust removal.
### Compressed Air/Vacuums
  - Compressed air can be used to clean out the inside of computer equipment as well as printers and other electronic devices
  - It is better to use **natural compressed air** versus any chemical-based compressed material
  - Only **specialized anti-static vacuums** should be used in electronic environments
  - These vacuums can help  reduce the risk of a static discharge or damage to the component.
## Power Surges, Under-Voltage Events, and Power Failures
  
  - Power issues can occur anytime and anywhere
  - These can range from total outages to flickers or surges, and they can be devastating to  equipment, data, and clients
  - A **power surge** occurs when a device receives too much power
  - An **under-voltage event**, such as a sag or brownout, occurs when the voltage dips below nominal operating levels for a set period
  - A **power failure** is when voltage completely stops.
### Battery Backup
  - An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is used to maintain power to equipment in the event of a power outage or surge when all power can be  lost or drop down below a certain threshold
  - The UPS will automatically  activate and provide power for the connected equipment via batteries.
### Surge Suppressor
  - A surge suppressor works by checking for spikes in voltage along the line
  - If a spike is detected, the surge protector moves the excess power to the ground and only allows the proper amount to be passed along to  the connected devices.
# Prohibited Content/Activity and Privacy, Licensing, and Policy
  - In addition to physical safety regulations, you must also be aware of and familiar with regulations pertaining to prohibited content and  activity as well as privacy, licensing, and policy
  - You must be able to  identify and explain the importance of these concepts.
## Incident Response
  - Incident response refers to the chain of actions and events that are taken once an incident occurs
  - A clear incident response plan should be  established by the company and followed to ensure a proper response
  - An  incident response plan typically follows the **basic steps** of detecting or identifying the incident, then responding, reporting,  recovering, remediating, documenting, and reviewing the incident.
### Chain of Custody
  - Chain of custody documentation is used as a **legally admissible map** of what, why, who, and where a material or piece of evidence is at all  times during an incident response
  - The chain of custody documentation  should address who obtained it, who secured it, who controlled it, and,  if moved, why it was moved, who moved it, how it was secured during the  move, and who controlled it.
### Management and Law Enforcement
  - Anytime an incident occurs that triggers the incident response protocol, management should be informed
  - Management will help to  evaluate the severity of the incident and decide whether the incident is potentially legally actionable
  - In some cases, law enforcement will  need to be notified, depending on the case
  - Some regulations, such as  regulations pertaining to PII, require a company to notify authorities  within a set period of time, depending on the number of customers  affected.
### Copy of Drive
  - When responding to an incident, evidence is collected in order of volatility to provide the most accurate levels of data integrity and  preservation
  - The **order of volatility** is RAM memory  contents first, then swap files and virtual memory, network processes,  system processes, filesystem information, and, finally, the raw disk  blocks.
### Documentation of Incident
  - Clear and precise documentation should be maintained at every step in the incident response process, beginning with the initial documentation of the incident, which may include pictures, notes, or logs
  - During the investigation phase of the incident and all during the process, *everything* must be documented to maintain the incident
  - Any slight infraction can lead to **tainted evidence** and the investigation being sidelined.
## Licensing/Digital Rights Management (DRM)/End-User License Agreement (EULA)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - For this exam, you should be very comfortable with the many types of licensing arrangements available today, including DRM and EULAs that  stipulate how the software can be used.
### Valid Licenses
  - A valid license is a software license that is **current and not counterfeit** and, if not already used, **valid** for activation.
### Non-Expired Licenses
  - A perpetual or non-expiring license is a license that, once purchased, is valid for the life of the software product
  - This licensing type is common with software such as video games.
### Personal Use License  vs. Corporate-Use License
  - A **personal license** is granted only to one end user for recreational purposes
  - At times, costly commercial software will  license its product for non-commercial use to an individual or student,  and this is intended for personal use only
### Corporate-use licenses
  - are intended for business use, typically by larger organizations, and  are a form of paid commercial software licensed to a specific company  for a certain number of users.
### Open-Source License
  - An open-source license means that the software’s source code is freely available to the public
  - This means the software can be modified  and recreated if desired by the end user.
## Regulated Data
  - Within the scope of information technology is data that must be held to a higher standard than that of other data
  - In cases of regulated  data, the federal government has developed standards for the handling of this data.
### Credit Card Transactions
  - Credit card transactions are regulated by the standards set in the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
  - These security standards ensure that all companies that accept,  process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain the  security of such information.
### Personal Government-Issued Information
  - Personal government-issued information is any personal information that is on a document issued by either the government or state, such as  driver’s licenses, social security cards, or birth certificates
  - While  there is no specific regulation pertaining to this information, it  should be securely stored and kept confidential
  - Much of the personal  information contained in these documents overlaps with other regulations pertaining to securing personal data, such as HIPAA regulations.
### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
  - PII refers to any data that can be used to identify a person or individual, either as a stand-alone or in conjunction with other  information
  - This information should always be kept secure and confidential.
### Healthcare Data
  - Healthcare data contains protected health information/personal health information (PHI) and is any piece of data that can identify an  individual or an ailment
  - This information is protected and regulated  through **HIPAA**
### Electronic health records (EHR)
  - are complete medical records of a patient in electronic form
  - EHRs  contain highly sensitive data and should be kept secure and confidential following HIPAA’s guidelines for usage.
### Data Retention Requirements
  - Data retention requirements are the policies and regulations set in place that require a specified amount of time that data should be  retained
  - These regulations vary by data type as well as by companies
  - Be aware of data retention requirements that affect your data type.
# Communication and Professionalism
  - IT technicians have to communicate effectively with many different audiences
  - Those working in IT should be aware of the following concepts in order to use proper communication techniques and professionalism
  - Questions in this section will be scenario based.
## Professional Appearance and Attire
  - As an IT technician, you will be judged based on your appearance and attire
  - You should dress in accordance with company policy as well as  how you wish to be perceived
  - You want to instill immediate confidence  and respect in those you interact with, which begins with your personal  appearance.
### Attire in the Given Environment
  - The attire you wear should reflect the environment in which you are working
  - Overdressing or underdressing will affect the way you are  perceived by the client.
### Formal
  - Formal, also known as **business formal** or **business professional**, usually requires a higher standard of dress that includes suits and  ties, long-sleeved button-down shirts, dark colors, and dress shoes for  men
  - Women are typically expected to wear a business suit or business  skirt
  - Women’s attire can be more lightly colored but should be  conservative in nature, with nylon stockings and dress shoes.
### Business Casual
  - Business casual provides a more lax style of dress for both men and women
  - This style, however, is not to be confused with casual or street  attire
  - Appropriate clothing items for men include dress pants or  khakis, collared shirts, and a more lenient color palette
  - Women have  many more options in clothing but should maintain a conservative style.
## Language
  - You should always use proper language when speaking with a customer or client
  - The majority of end users are not very technology oriented,  so you should **avoid tech slang and acronyms**
  - Instead,  break down the meaning of all terms used in a constructive manner
  - We  sometimes get caught up in technical language and should always avoid  “tech speak” or talking above the client’s head.
## Attitude
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - You should display a positive attitude when dealing with technical issues that may be complex
  - Use all cases as lessons to acquire more  knowledge about technology
  - Also, be **confident** when discussing technical issues with end users
  - Be aware that it is more about being able to *find* the right answer than having all the answers memorized
  - Regardless of  the situation, remain positive and project confidence in your work
  - Customers know that you don’t know everything, but you should avoid  giving the impression that you are unsure of the procedure for finding a solution.
## Listening
  - When discussing issues with a customer, **actively listen** and **take notes** when appropriate
  - Customers should never have to repeat themselves because you did not write down key details
  - Additionally, **never interrupt** customers while they are giving you information
  - Let them tell you  their story in full, and then you can respond with follow-up questions  if needed
  - Always listen to understand what the customer is saying.
## Cultural Sensitivity
  - Remember that some people have different cultural backgrounds than others, so you should remain culturally sensitive to their requests
  - A **language** barrier may present itself, making communication difficult
  - Maintain  respect and composure and do not treat the person with a dismissive  nature
  - Also, be mindful that other cultures have different **mannerisms and values**.
### Professional Titles
  - You should always greet users with respect and use their proper professional titles when addressing them
  - If someone is a director,  don’t refer to them as a manager—not in person, in support  documentation, or on the phone with one of your colleagues
  - This is an  easy way to offend someone.
## Punctuality
  - Punctuality is extremely important for an IT professional
  - Often, end users have meetings or their own work to complete, and you are seen as  the entity that is holding them up
  - Always arrive on time for  pre-scheduled appointments and contact clients if there will be any  delay relating to the service
  - If anything keeps you from arriving at  the client’s location on time, notify the customer of your situation  beforehand and give them an estimated arrival time.
## Distractions
  - While working with clients, be sure to avoid any type of distractions
  - This includes text messages, phone calls, or simply having conversations with other colleagues
  - You never want to give the impression that the end user does not have 100% of your attention
  - Their technical problem must appear to be the number one priority when you  are in their presence, even though that may not be the case.
### Personal Calls
  - Personal calls should not be answered when working with a client
  - Silence phones or send incoming calls straight to voicemail to avoid  interruption.
### Texting/Social Media Sites
  - Texting should also be avoided when interacting with a client
  - Answering text messages or receiving constant notifications when with a client is disrespectful
  - Additionally, do not browse social media sites  when working with a client.
### Personal Interruptions
  - Personal interruptions should be kept to a minimum
  - This is especially true for individuals working from home
  - Maintain a space  where personal interruptions can be minimized.
## Difficult Customers or Situations
  - Working as an IT technician, you will be faced with stressed and anxious clients who may become difficult
  - While these situations do  occur in the field, it is important to adhere to some basic rules for  diffusing the situation with the following five don’ts and one do.
### **DON’T**  Argue
  - Arguing with customers will not get the result that either of you are hoping to achieve
  - Try not to become defensive when speaking with a client, even if they seem like they are being unreasonable
  - Letting the  customer know that you understand their frustration will help them to  feel confident that you can help them solve the problem.
### **DON’T**  Be Defensive
  - When a client is upset or angry, he or she may lash out at you as a way of venting their frustration
  - Avoid being defensive and taking it  personally
  - Remind the customer that you are there to help and you  understand how frustrated they are
  - Lead the client to focus on the  problem and not on you.
### **DON’T**  Dismiss Customer Problems
  - Try to avoid dismissing the customer’s problems or issues
  - Even though an issue may not seem like a big deal to you, it may be very  important to them.
### **DON’T**  Be Judgmental
  - Avoid being judgemental when working with clients
  - Something that may seem easy and self-explanatory to you could be quite challenging and  difficult for them
  - It’s important to keep in mind that not everyone is  tech-savvy.
### **DON’T**  Recount Experiences on Social Media
  - Never use social media as an outlet to vent about a particular customer or experience
  - Things on the internet typically stay there  forever, and this could portray you or your company in a bad light.
### **DO**  Clarify Customer Statements
  - Ask questions to ascertain the root of the problem
  - When a customer tells you their story, restate what you believe the problem to be to  confirm an understanding through the verification process
  - Some helpful  clarification tactics include asking the client to walk you through the  problem, asking open-ended questions, restating what the client is  saying, and asking specific questions to verify your understanding of  the problem.
## Using a Timeline
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - When working on a client issue, always be prepared to set initial expectations of the timeline with the promise of action to follow
  - Keep  the customer informed of any changes, but make sure all promises are  kept in a timely manner.
### Offer Options
  - If possible, give the customer multiple options and alternatives
  - Even if you prefer one way, remember this is the end user’s equipment  and they should be given the opportunity to weigh their options
  - This  may include the option to repair or replace the problem device or  component
  - Do not make the customer feel as if they are being railroaded into a specific choice.
### Use Documentation
  - Keep up-to-date documentation and provide this to the customer when the service is complete
  - Customers will feel more at ease if they can  review what work was performed on their PC, as they will know exactly  how their money was spent on the repair
  - Using thorough documentation  will also protect you in case of a dispute.
### Follow Up
  - When the device has been returned to the customer after service, follow up at a later time to verify satisfaction
  - This is one of the  most important steps for maintaining repeat customers, as they will feel like you genuinely care about the service.
## Dealing with Private Customer Materials
  - When working on a customer’s issue, use best practices in handling their data
  - This is the customer’s private information and directly  accessing this data is usually not required to complete a repair
  - It is  your duty to keep that information safe and secure for as long as it’s  in your possession.
### Locations of Private Materials
  - Access to the locations of private customer materials, whether on a computer, desktop, printer, hard drive, etc., should be limited and done in a secure location
  - Be mindful of who may be able to view or gain  access to private materials to minimize the possibility of data  breaches.
# Scripting
  - Scripting can be used to automate IT management processes
  - It is important to be familiar with all of these concepts.
## Script File Types
  - There are numerous scripting languages in use, each with its own syntax and nuances
  - You should be familiar with the most common script  languages and be able to recognize their file types.
### .bat
  - A batch file is a series of commands to be run by the Windows operating system stored in a plain text file.
### .ps1
  - A .ps1 file is used to run scripts in Powershell.
### .vbs
  - A .vbs file contains lines of codes in the Visual Basic programming language that are encoded in plain text format.
### .sh
  - A .sh file is like the batch files of Windows, but they can be executed in Linux or Unix.
### .js
  - A .js file is a script written in JavaScript.
### .py
  - A .py script is a script written in the Python programming language.
## Use Cases for Scripting
  - Use cases for scripting are scenarios that you are likely to encounter as an IT technician
  - You should be familiar with the most  common use cases.
### Basic Automation
  - Automation uses a set script to perform a specific task that needs to remain constant each time the script is run
  - Basic automation may be  used for creating users or adding users to a group.
### Restarting Machines
  - Scripting is useful for restarting machines when multiple machines need to be restarted
  - By creating a script, you automate the process  rather than having to command each machine individually.
### Remapping Network Drives
  - Mapping a drive is the process of mounting a remote filesystem to a drive letter
  - Creating a script for the process ensures a reproducible  result each time.
### Installation of Applications
  - Scripting can be used for the installation of applications to ease the process
  - For example, a script may be written that requires the  successful installation of all prerequisites before the application is  installed rather than having to manually install each prerequisite prior to application installation.
### Automated Backups
  - Scripts may also be used to automate the backup process to increase reliability
  - For example, a script may be used to automate the backup of a SQL database.
### Gathering of Information/Data
  - When dealing with information and data gathering about a network, device, or batch of devices, scripting can be more efficient than using a **graphical user interface (GUI)**
  - With a scripting command, you are able to view the exact data you need without having to maneuver through a GUI.
### Initiating Updates
  - Installing updates is a common automated process offered on operating systems such as the Windows OS
  - However, this process may not update  and install a patch as quickly as it may be needed
  - To immediately  initiate an update, a script may be used.
## Other Considerations
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - While using scripts can be highly effective, there are also many considerations to be aware of that may affect your device or your entire system.
### Introducing Malware
  - Be aware of the potential for introducing malware into a system via a script
  - Sometimes you may need additional scripts to aid in the  functionality or a script
  - Scripts can be imported using a third-party  tool
  - Third-party tools, however, are a common environment for malware  to reside
  - Malware may be attached to the script and inserted  unintentionally.
### Changing System Settings
  - Scripts, such as those for basic automation, are commonly used to make changes to a system
  - However, if not properly executed, the script  may make unintentional changes to other system settings
  - Try new scripts in a test environment before implementing them, if possible.
### Browser or System Crashes
  - Scripting can be a powerful tool in helping to automate processes
  - However, if not properly constructed, a script can inadvertently consume resources, such as RAM, leading to system crashes.
# Remote Access Technologies
  - Accessing devices remotely is a major part of troubleshooting issues
  - Questions in this section will be scenario based, and you will need to  be able to identify and use these common methods and tools.
## Methods and Tools
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - Methods and tools for remote connection vary and may be dependent upon the OS.
### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  - RDP is a Microsoft proprietary technology for remotely accessing Windows computers
  - RDP provides a user with a graphical interface to  connect to another computer over a network connection
  - RDP uses TCP port 3389.
### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
  - A VPN can be used for secure remote access by creating an encrypted tunnel through which the data is transmitted and accessed
  - Common VPN  configurations include a site-to-site VPN, a client-to-site VPN, or a  clientless VPN.
### Virtual Network Computer (VNC)
  - VNC is an open-source protocol similar to RDP that provides a tool for sharing desktops
  - VNC operates on a client-server model and usually  only allows the use of one console on an OS at a time.
### Secure Shell (SSH)
  - SSH creates a two-way communication connection between computers over a network connection
  - SSH is a terminal-based program with no graphical interface
  - SSH operates on port 22.
### Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)
  - RMM provides a way for a company to monitor and manage multiple devices over a wide range of locations through a single interface
  - There are numerous RMM software packages available on the market
  - RMM  software requires the placement of an agent on each connected device  that reports back to the primary agent or the managed service provider  (MSP).
### Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA)
  - MSRA is a Windows program that allows for remote connection to a compatible device by a trusted user via an invitation
  - RDP must be  allowed and active for a MSRA connection to be established.
### Third-Party Tools
  - Many third-party tools can provide a quick, reliable, and efficient way to connect to computers.
#### Screen-Sharing Software
  - One common feature that most third-party remote access tools include is screen sharing
  - A screen-sharing feature allows a technician to view  the client’s screen and see exactly what they are seeing
  - Popular  examples are Splashtop and TeamViewer.
#### Video-Conferencing Software
  - Video-conferencing software is similar to screen-sharing software but offers added functionality, such as allowing multiple users to join in  at once as well as calendar invitations and attendee management
  - Popular examples include Microsoft Teams and Zoom.
#### File Transfer Software
  - File transfer software is software dedicated solely to sharing files
  - Popular examples include Dropbox and OneDrive.
#### Desktop Management Software
  - Desktop Management Software is an extension of screen-sharing, which, when integrated with other management software such as Intun, allows  for complete device management remotely
  - To be considered desktop  management software, the extension must be configured to await an  incoming connection.
## Security Considerations for Each Method
  - When considering which remote access option to use, it’s vital to consider the security ramifications
  - Take into consideration the type of data being transmitted, the encryption level of the method, and the  transmission method
  - Keep in mind that any remote connection accessed  via an internet connection may be vulnerable to attack.
### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  - RDP may be vulnerable through the use of weak credentials as well as the known usage of port 3389, which may be  targeted for an on-path attack.
### VPN Security Considerations
  - A VPN may be vulnerable through weak encryption, leaks, and malware infection transmission.
### VNC
  - The most glaring security concern of a VNC is that it is open source and is not natively encrypted
  - Encryption may be  added via a plug-in.
### SSH
  - The main security concerns with SSH is the ability of SSH to port forward as well as the convenience of users sharing keys.
### RMM
  - RMM’s security issues include embedded malware, vulnerability to brute-force attacks, and the human component through  credential sharing or targeted social engineering attacks.
### MSRA
  - MSRA is only accessible via the run dialog box and is not automatically configured to connect via an internet  connection
  - Firewalls and routers disrupt the functionality of MSRA  unless configured properly.
### Third-party tools
  - Be wary when using third-party tools
  - Each type of tool may be vulnerable to any number of threats,  such as weak credentials, brute-force attacks, on-path attacks, embedded malware, weak or no encryption, etc.
